* Refactor thought-storage - move fetch methods to separate file
* Fetch currently viewed thought - not always brain as root node.
* Store thoughts in localStorage. Don't make request to google login before displaying cached thoughts.
* Hide thoughts that are far from currently viewed (mb 2-3 nodes away).
  No! Need to hide neighboor thoughts (sibling) because there are no space on circle to display new child thoughts!
* Add indicator that thought has no children (and that thought might have children (not fetched yet)).
