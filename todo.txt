0) Repair coming back to selected thought from create thought page (store thoughts tree in thought-storage! To easily find thought by id at any f***ing moment).
1) show thought content! :)
2) Store thoughts in localStorage. Don't make request to google login before displaying cached thoughts.
3) Hide thoughts that are far from currently viewed (mb 2-3 nodes away).
No! Need to hide neighboor thoughts (sibling) because there are no space on circle to display new child thoughts!
4) save selected thought in url.
5) Add indicator that thought has no children (and that thought might have children (not fetched yet)).
